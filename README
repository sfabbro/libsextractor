This is the SExtractor package (http://www.astromatic.net/) packed
into a library mainly for compatibility with the poloka software.
The wrapping around SExtractor in poloka is quite ugly, so any inspiration
in the poloka code should be kept to a minimum.

Many changes were applied on the upstream SExtractor package, but it
was quite a while ago and have not been so far updated to a more
recent version.

If you are *really* interested in packaging SExtractor into a library,
feel free to copy around the autotools file to a more recent
SExtractor version, but I do not recommend to copy blindly the code
difference, since some of them were specifically applied for poloka.

Last version taken from upstream was: 2.4.4.

This is what we apply on SExtractor:
* Simplify configure.ac and use libtool
* Change the Makefile.am to allow libtoolization
* Add a pkg-config file sextractor.pc.in
* Remove src/poly.* (duplicate symbols from wcs/poly.*)
* Many more c code changes. The history is quite long, so we provide
  the patch to the various bits of code below. You can use the file
  sextractor-2.4.4-poloka.patch as a patch to see what changed from
  upstream SExtractor.

Below is the original README file from SExtractor.


SExtractor stands for ``Source Extractor'': a software for making
catalog of sources from astronomical images.
Multi-Extension FITS is now supported. Binary output catalogs are also MEFs.
ASCII output catalogs contain detections from all extensions merged together.
Use the "EXT_NUMBER" catalog parameter to identify the extension on which a
given source was detected. Check-images will also be written as MEFs if the
input image is a MEF.
- The (main) default config file can be dumped by typing "sex -d". Secondary
configuration files like default.param are still needed, though.

In case of problems, questions or suggestions related to the software,
please don't hesitate to send a mail (preferably in english) to the
official mailing list:
sextractor@iap.fr
These questions and answers to them are posted on the Web at:

In any case you can still reach me at bertin@iap.fr. I cannot garantee
that I will reply immediately, but I will try for sure to provide
an answer.

Notes:
- A version "sextractor-2.3.1_lanl" of SExtractor is available on
SourceForge thanks to Mark Galassi and Dan Starr:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/sextractor/
It is a reconditioned version of SExtractor 2.2.2. The LanL and the TERAPIX
(present one) versions follow two different development branches.
- Benne Holwerda <holwerda@stsci.edu> has written a SExtractor handbook and a
GUI which can be found in the doc/ subdirectory or at
http://www-int.stsci.edu/~holwerda/se.html
